# DarkWeb Monitor

A Python-based OSINT tool designed for monitoring dark web sources for specified keywords or data leaks. This tool prioritizes privacy and security by utilizing the Tor network for anonymous operations.

## Features

- Tor network integration for anonymous scanning
- Dark web monitoring capabilities
- IP rotation functionality
- Rich console interface with progress tracking
- Detailed logging with colored output
- Report integrity verification using SHA256
- Configurable output formats
- YAML-based configuration
- Rate limiting and safety measures

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Tor service installed and running

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/darkweb-monitor.git
cd darkweb-monitor
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install and configure Tor:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install tor

# macOS
brew install tor
```

4. Configure the tool by editing `config.yml`

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
python darkweb_monitor.py "search keyword"
```

With output file:
```bash
python darkweb_monitor.py "search keyword" -o report.txt
```

## Safety and Legal Considerations
